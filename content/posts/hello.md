# About me
Hi, I'm Quang and I like all sorts of things. Research, Software Development, NeoVim/Emacs, Game Dev, making this blog, you name it. This blog, though, is primarily a space for me to dump my thoughts on complicated topics, especially in **Maths and AI**. Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss further, these blog posts are, after all, open drafts that always welcome improvement suggestions.
